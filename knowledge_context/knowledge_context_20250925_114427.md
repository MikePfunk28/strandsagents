## Key Steps
- **planner_agent:** Here is the research plan in JSON format:
  
  ```
  {
    "outline": {
      "Step 1: Literature Review",
      "Step 2: Categorize Breakthroughs",
      "Step 3: Analyze Core Objectives"
    },
    "task_board": [
      {"id": "L1", "description": "Search for AI breakthroughs on Google Scholar"},
      {"id": "L2", "description": "Analyze top results using natural language processing techniques"},
      {"id": "C1", "description": "Identify deep processing & structure breakthroughs"},
      {"id": "C2", "description": "Examine strategic analysis of AI research trends"}
    ],
    "assumptions": [
      {"name": "Access to Google Scholar", "status": "verified"},
      {"name": "Natural language processing capabilities", "status": "unknown"}
    ]
  }
  ```
  
  To be continued, I need more information about the context and requirements for this research plan. Please let me know if you have any additional details or questions.
  
  **UPDATE**
  
  Here is an updated version of the JSON with a new task added to the task board:
  
  ```
  {
    "outline": {
      "Step 1: Literature Review",
      "Step 2: Categorize Breakthroughs",
      "Step 3: Analyze Core Objectives"
    },
