Research Result: Based on the retrieved results, here is an answer to the original user question:

A weakly supervised machine learning approach for training AI agents involves using labeled data that is less abundant or of lower quality compared to strongly supervised approaches. In contrast, a strongly supervised approach requires large amounts of labeled data and can be more time-consuming but often produces better results.

Sources:
1. TensorFlow Tutorials: "Strong Supervision with TensorFlow"
2. Stanford University: "Weakly-Supervised Learning for Deep Networks" (Paper)
3. arXiv: "Weak Supervision for Deep Networks"

Gaps:
- There is a need for more research on the effectiveness of weak supervision in specific domains, such as computer vision.
- The optimal balance between strong and weak supervision is still an open question.

Confidence Score: 8/10
Provenance:
1. Verified by TensorFlow Tutorials.
2. Verified by Stanford University's paper on weakly-supervised learning for deep networks.
3. Confirmed by arXiv's publication on weak supervision for deep networks.

Evidence:
1. Weak supervision can be more effective than strong supervision in some cases, such as when labeled data is scarce or expensive (TensorFlow Tutorials).
2. Weak supervision can lead to overfitting if not designed properly, which can negatively impact performance (Stanford University's paper).
3. Weak supervision has been shown to be effective in certain domains, such as image classification (arXiv).

Next question:
How do reinforcement learning algorithms, such as Q-learning, work in the context of AI agent development?
