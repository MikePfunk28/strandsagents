### 3. Integration Points

#### MCP Configuration
- **mcp.json**: Context7 MCP server configured but not currently available
- **.mcp.json**: Claude-flow, ruv-swarm, flow-nexus, sublinear-solver configured

#### Context7 Integration (Planned)
- Semantic search capabilities via Upstash context7
- Knowledge base integration
- Vector similarity operations

### 4. Missing Components (Per DESIGN.md)

#### Database Systems (Needed)
- **cache.db**: Response caching for performance
- **memory.db**: Context and conversation memory
- **knowledge.db**: External knowledge from outside sources
- **coderl.db**: Code understanding with embeddings per file

#### Orchestration System (Needed)
- **Orchestrator Agent**: Uses llama3.2:3b for complex reasoning
- **Executor Agent**: Workflow execution and management
- **Async Iterators**: For streaming workflows
- **Callback Handlers**: For event-driven coordination

#### Workflow Management (Needed)
- **Agent Workflows**: Using strands workflows
- **Task Distribution**: Multi-agent task coordination
- **Result Synthesis**: Combining outputs from multiple agents

## Code-Assistant Issues Found

### Import Problems in code-assistant/
The code-assistant directory has import issues that need fixing:

1. **Incorrect strands imports**: Many files use outdated import patterns
2. **Missing dependencies**: Some required packages not properly imported
3. **Local vs global imports**: Mixing relative and absolute imports incorrectly

### Files Needing Import Fixes:
- coding_agent.py
- coding_assistant.py
- adversarial_coding_system.py
- agent2agent_coordinator.py
- And several others in code-assistant/

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed
- Base assistant framework
- Specialized agents (research, creative, critical, summarizer)
- MCP communication system
- Meta-tooling for dynamic tool creation
- Local Ollama model integration

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- Context7 semantic search integration
- Database systems implementation
- Code-assistant import fixes

### ðŸ“‹ TODO
- Orchestrator agent with llama3.2:3b
- Workflow orchestration system
- Database schema and implementation
- Integration testing
- Performance optimization

## Key Design Principles Followed

1. **Local Only**: All models use local Ollama (gemma:270m, llama3.2)
2. **Microservices**: Each agent is a lightweight, specialized service
3. **MCP Communication**: Agent-to-agent messaging via MCP protocol
4. **Meta-Tooling**: Dynamic tool creation for extensibility
5. **Async First**: All operations use async/await patterns
6. **Caching**: Results cached for performance
7. **Modular**: Clear separation of concerns

## Next Steps

1. Fix code-assistant import issues
2. Implement database systems (cache.db, memory.db, knowledge.db, coderl.db)
3. Create orchestrator agent with larger model
4. Set up workflow orchestration
5. Integrate context7 when MCP server becomes available
6. Performance testing and optimization
