Tool Consent and Bypassing¶
By default, certain tools that perform potentially sensitive operations (like file modifications, shell commands, or code execution) will prompt for user confirmation before executing. This safety feature ensures users maintain control over actions that could modify their system.

To bypass these confirmation prompts, you can set the BYPASS_TOOL_CONSENT environment variable:


# Set this environment variable to bypass tool confirmation prompts
export BYPASS_TOOL_CONSENT=true
Setting the environment variable within Python:


import os

os.environ["BYPASS_TOOL_CONSENT"] = "true"
When this variable is set to true, tools will execute without asking for confirmation. This is particularly useful for:

Automated workflows where user interaction isn't possible
Development and testing environments
CI/CD pipelines
Situations where you've already validated the safety of operations
Note: Use this feature with caution in production environments, as it removes an important safety check.
